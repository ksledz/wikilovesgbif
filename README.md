a webapp inspired by wikilovesinat.netlify.app. /res/[GBIF species id] url shows CC 4.0 licensed images of a species with a specific id and links for their wikimedia commons uploads. /all/[GBIF species id] url shows all GBIF images with their licenses and links for upload. /obs/[GBIF observation id] shows pics of an observation and links for their uploads regardless of license. very WIP.
